     You may be asking yourself  “What exactly is TEEN TALK?” and well, we’ve got the answer for you. TEEN TALK is a company that we created that everyone but specifically teenagers can become aware of the mental health issues such as anxiety and depression so that they don’t feel ‘crazy’ or alone if they identify with some of the symptoms. All we want is to make it easier to understand and to be able to explain it well enough that they hopefully go and reach out for help or at the very least become aware of these pressing matters. We believe that this website can help those who don’t have enough resources to be able to get help with the videos we provide and our educational resources absolutely free of charge. One of the biggest challenges that teenagers can face is feeling alone in their struggles and having no clue what to do. Luckily TEEN TALK aims to be able to fight this feeling by creating a safe and supportive community where teens can be able to connect with others that are going through similar experiences. It’s also always good to be able to know about anxiety and depression because while it may not affect you, it can affect those you surround yourself with such as friends and family and if you know about it, you could help them with your knowledge and recommend things to help! 

     <br>
     <br>
     
     Overall, we try our best to provide a safe space that helps teens learn about what they’re going through, be able to talk to others who are going through similar things, and offer a variety of resources that help teens learn even more about their mental health and how to take care of themselves. If you or someone you know is struggling with anxiety and depression, 
     <br>
     we highly recommend checking us out!

      <h2 id="1"> <pre>      Our Mission    </pre></h2>
      <p> 
        
      The impact that anxiety and depression have on teenage lives is immense and deserves to be acknowledged and we want just that. Most of the time when teenagers are sad or anxious it's normally brushed off by the adults present with the excuse that it’ll pass and that “it’s a part of every persons teenage years”, but sometimes it can be way more than that. Anxiety and depression is a serious problem that can affect not only their mood, but their energy levels and ability to concentrate which is very difficult considering if you’re a teen that needs to focus on school, work, sports, and/or other things you may have accumulated. It can also lead to physical symptoms like headaches, stomach aches and fatigue. Therefore it makes it difficult for teenagers to enjoy their lives, participate in things, and to have a good relationship with others, whether it be romantically or completely platonic.

If these problems are left untreated, it can have a long term consequence since it can increase the risk of substance abuse, self-harm, and suicide. Some people think they have no other alternative and end up abusing themselves because of that fact. 

<br>
<br>
        
We believe that everyone deserves access to mental health resources, regardless of where they come from or their financial situation. That’s why TEEN TALK was created; to help others no matter what. Here at TEEN TALK we offer our  services for free to anyone who needs it and/or is willing to learn about anxiety and depression. We also believe in the power and the impact that  education has on others. With today's social media, teenagers don’t  always have an accurate source from where they can get their information and can be a barrier to seek actual help for what they’re struggling with. Lastly, we believe in the power of a community. Feeling connected to others is a key part of mental health for everyone because it makes us feel as though we’re not alone. That’s why we made TEEN TALK, we have various resources where you can learn in depth about anxiety and depression and what comes with it and a platform where others can connect through their shared experiences

  <p> What IS Anxiety? 

    <br> 
    <br>
    Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome or an imminent event. It’s a natural response to stress and can be helpful in some situations, but when it becomes persistent, it can interfere with a person's daily life and well being.

            <img src="who am i.jpg">

    Hey there! I’m Ainara Expósito, I’m 15 and I was born and raised in Puerto Rico till Hurricane Maria happened where I moved to South Carolina and lived there till 8th grade where I moved back to Puerto Rico. I like to play soccer or really any sport there is to offer, I love to read a lot, and lastly I like to watch a bunch of movies and series. 
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
I chose to make a website about anxiety and depression within teenagers because I’ve noticed that it has a major impact in their everyday lives and not everyone knows about these themes. When I was in school everyone always said how stressed they were or how off they’ve been feeling and just passed it off as an everyday occurrence instead of actually trying to learn about their feelings and how to get better.
    <br>
    <br>
That’s why I created TEEN TALK, it’s a website targeted towards teenagers so that they can feel more comfortable with their feelings and be able to reach out for help.
